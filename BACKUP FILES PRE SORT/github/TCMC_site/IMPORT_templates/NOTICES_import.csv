My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7. If you would like to take part, please call Merle Trembath 0418882633 anytime ",,,noticeID_1_img.png,Volunteer Singers / Musicians,2,jessica.mckenzie@my.jcu.edu.au,21/03/15,"Calling all Muso’s, entertainers, performers.

Because these venues have no foyer space, the theatre has to be open about an hour before the concert, so that audience members don't have to stand outside in the sun, wind, and rain.. Instead of playing bland recorded music before the show, we prefer to have student musicians playing on stage when the doors open. For the musicians, this is effectively a practice session with a live audience; they don't have to ""perform"", they can stop and start as they please. They need to be of reasonably high standard, but they don't have to be polished performers. About 15 minutes before the concert start time, our compere introduces them, acknowledges the contribution of their school, and the curtain closes. The students are then welcome to stay for the concert. The students are considered volunteers, but we can help pay for expenses incurred. Small instrumental groups are preferred. The offer is open to all schools, so we need to schedule in advance. FOTT have 6 concerts per year, the Music Centre about 10. If you would like to take part, please let us know so we can send you a list of concert dates as soon as they are confirmed. Call us on 4724 2086 or email -admin@townsvillemusic.org.au",,,,Our Live House Music service,17,jessica.mckenzie@my.jcu.edu.au,24/01/15,"The Bulletin Board is a free service, intended not only for selling or advertising, but also for any items of news or general interest.
