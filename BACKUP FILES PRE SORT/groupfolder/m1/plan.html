<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience of this site are people of the age of 40 and up.  To cater to this target audience the site will have a simple, easy to navigate design. The pages colour scheme will be mostly neutral and not too flashy; contrasts will be employed to make it easier for vision impaired users. The site’s pages will have improved structures in comparison to the original so that less links are needed, decreasing the amount users have to click and simplifying the design as intended. The pages will also provide more information in text so that the user will feel more confident when he/she is informed. </p>

•	Events<br>
•	Artists<br>
•	Members<br>

The bulletin board will be represented as “Notices” in a section to the right which will be featured in all pages. The login section has been placed inside of the header element so, like notices, it will be on all pages.
