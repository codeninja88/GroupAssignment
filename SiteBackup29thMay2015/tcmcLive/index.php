                        Townsville has a population of about 200,000 and is growing at about 1 suburb per year, so there is a lot of musical activity. All private         schools and most government schools have music teachers. The larger private schools are Townsville Grammar, the Cathedral School and Ryan         Catholic College. The larger public high schools are Kirwan and Pimlico.</p>
